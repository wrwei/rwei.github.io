              <p>Safety-critical systems require justifications that they are acceptably safe to operate in their defined operational contexts. 
                To obtain such justifications, a engineering process typically referred to as Safety Critical Systems Engineering (SCSE) is followed. 
                Depending on the application domain, different activities are involved in SCSE. 
                SCSE requires extensive analysis, verification and validation activities of engineering artifacts, produced using different tools and in different formats.
                For most systems, a safety case must be developed, and often independently reviewed before the systems can be certified.
                However, existing SCSE activities require extensive manual efforts, this becomes a bottleneck, especially when (1) the complexity of systems inevitably grow; 
                (2) systems are increasingly adaptive (they react to changing running contexts) and open (they connect to other systems) at runtime.
              </p>
              <p>To address the above challenge, my research is focused on adopting state of the art technologies to enable automated means for the activities in SCSE.
                I have had the honour to work with some great researchers and scientists to look at automated validation of safety cases, automated system safety analysis, automated verification of system behaviours, and trustworthiness of systems at runtime.
                My previous endavours have been leveraging Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) technologies due to the degree of automation they provide. 
                I am currently looking at using Digital Twin technolgoies for the runtime monitoring and assurance of systems (and systems of systems). 
                I am also looking at the possibility of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the development and assurance of systems. 
                All comments are welcome! Email me if you have any questions.
